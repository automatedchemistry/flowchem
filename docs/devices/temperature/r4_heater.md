# Vapourtec R4 heating module

The Vapourtec R4 module can be used both as a standalone reactor temperature control unit or as a part of an R2 assembly.
Here the former case is assumed, for a description of the R2 reactor visit the [R2 reactor](../misc/r2_reactor.md) page.

```{note} Serial connection parameters
Note, further parameters for the serial connections (i.e. those accepted by `serial.Serial`) such as `baudrate`,
`parity`, `stopbits` and `bytesize` can be specified.
However, it should not be necessary as the following values (which are the default for the instrument) are
automatically used:
* timeout 0.1s
* baudrate 19200
* parity none
* stopbits 1
* bytesize 8
```

## API methods
See the [device API reference](../../api/r4_heater/api.md) for a description of the available methods.
