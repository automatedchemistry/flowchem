# Hamilton Syringe Pump ML600

Hamilton ML600 pumps connected via serial (RS-232) cables are supported in flowchem via the `ML600` device type.
As for all `flowchem` devices, the virtual instrument can be instantiated via a configuration file that generates an
openAPI endpoint.


## Configuration
Configuration sample showing all possible parameters:

```toml
[device.my-ml600-pump]  # This is the pump identifier
type = "ML600"
port = "COM1"  # This will be /dev/tty* under linux/MacOS
address= 1  # If multiple devices are daisy chained, number in the chain 1=first...
syringe_volume = "1 ml"  # If the wrong syringe volume is set, the flow rate will be wrong.
```

```{note} Serial connection parameters
Note, further parameters for the serial connections (i.e. those accepted by `serial.Serial`) such as `baudrate`,
`parity`, `stopbits` and `bytesize` can be specified.
However, it should not be necessary as the following values (which are the default for the instrument) are
automatically used:
* baudrate 9600
* parity even
* stopbits 1
* bytesize 7
```

## Device detection
Lab PCs often have several devices connected via serial ports.
A simple command can help you to identify the serial port connected to the ML600 pump.

Simply run the `ml600-finder` command from the command line, after having installed flowchem.
% FIXME add a successful connection example here :D
```shell
(flowchem)  dario@eeepc > /tmp/pycharm_project_420 $ ml600-finder
2022-09-14 15:04:37.026 | INFO     | flowchem.devices.hamilton.ML600_finder:ml600_finder:14 - Found the following serial port(s): ['/dev/ttyS0']
