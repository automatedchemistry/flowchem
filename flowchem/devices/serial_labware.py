"serial_labware" -- Generic base class for communicating with lab equipment via serial connection

.. moduleauthor:: Sebastian Steiner <s.steiner.1@research.gla.ac.uk>

(c) 2018 The Cronin Group, University of Glasgow

This provides a generic python class for safe serial communication
with various lab equipment over serial interfaces (RS232, RS485, USB)
by sending command strings. This parent class handles establishing
a connection as well as sending and receiving commands.
Based on code originally developed by Stefan Glatzel.
