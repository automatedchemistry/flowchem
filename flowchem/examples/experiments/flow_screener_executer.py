# ToDo
#  A)  for experiment:
#  OK 1) Create reasonable boundary conditions -> from experiment
#  OK 2) equivalents  and residence time are the x and y axis, yield the z.  Flow rates follow from residence time and equivalents
#  OK 3) within these, create a matrix with a reasonable number of points  -> 9 * 10? 1, 1.1, 1.2 - 1.9, 1-10 min. flowrate = Ivol / Rtime. from this, individual flow rates follow
#  OK 4) Iterate through these points, being the conditions for the experiment and do this 2 times, in orthogonal direction
#  B) for hardware and control
#  OK 1) make sure that the syringes don't stall/empty with keepalive
#  OK 2) set  flow rate for first point
#  OK 3) start syringes once
#  OK 4) wait for equilibration
#  5) measure spectra and calculate yield. repeat that 3 times
#  C) Inputs and outputs should be:
#  OK 1) a dictionary, also check what was used in the sugar optimizer, probably bendable. Go for pandas data frame
#  OK kind of 2) output needs to be condition and yield. Simply append yield to empty field in data frame?
