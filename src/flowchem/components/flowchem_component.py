    name : str
        The name of the component.
    hw_device : FlowchemDevice
        The hardware device instance associated with this component.
    component_info : ComponentInfo
        Metadata about the component.
    _router : APIRouter
        The API router for the component to define HTTP endpoints.

    Methods:
    --------
