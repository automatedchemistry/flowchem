    - a `get_position()` method

    # I kind of disagree, human friendly is misleading in this aspect
    # the human friendly approach is just needed because we are used to it, however, there is a simple solution that
    # allows to map human-friendly and graph applicable to the physical world. More concrete: If we have an injection
    # valve, we need to look at the specific valve and need to decide what inject and load mean, given the current
    # connections, which requires some transfer. My suggestion is: Instead of going to positions, specify which ports to
    # connect. In case of a simple multiposition valve, it always connects the always open port to the requested port.
    # But there are more complex rotors available, already with an injection valve: connect((1, 2)) would be more neat.
    # What is even more important, one can specify which ports to not connect (optionally during switching) but when
    # connected. This issue arose with hamilton valves, where some positions connect 3 ports and it is very hard to
    # foresee what command does what. SO here a simple connect((1,2)) would be great.

    # In order for that to work, and to make the coding and usage simple and concise, some definitions are needed:
    # 1) The port zero can exist, but does not necessarily. I advocate it to be the one on the valve turning axis, the
    #   port that on some valves is always open
    # 2) from there, one goes up, and yes that means simply looking up at the physical valve. The port straight on top
    #   of port zero is port 1
    # 3) If there is no port straight on top, then one goes in clockwise direction, until a port comes
    # 4 )Beware: For logical reasons, we need to introduce ports of "number" None. These are needed because we need to
    #   define dead-ends. These dead-ends are IMMUTABLE dead-ends, so the stator or rotor do not have a opneing there
    # 5) Mutable dead-ends: blanking plugs are treated as port number, the consumer needs to deal with its definition by
    #   graph or similar
    # Dead-ends are needed because we represent valves as graphs, edges are represented by same numbers shared. If a
    # port does not connect to anything, we set it None. There is 1 example where that is strictly needed for the logic
    # to work: Again the hamilton, it will become clear why. So much now: The rotor has more open positions than the
    # stator. Actually, Any time there is a different amount of positions on rotor and stator, this will be needed.
