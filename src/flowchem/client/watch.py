class Watch:
    """
    A class used to monitor and log the behavior of flowchem devices in real-time, recording data from devices
    and components at a specified time interval. It also allows setting custom conditions (rules) to monitor
    specific values from the devices and raise errors if the conditions are violated.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    experimental_id : int | str
        Unique identifier for the experiment being monitored.

    address : str
        Directory path where logs and data will be saved, appended with experiment id.

    discrete_time : float
        Time interval in seconds at which data from the devices is logged.

    add_info : dict | None
        Additional information related to the experiment to be stored as a `.toml` file.

    devices : dict
        A dictionary of all flowchem devices obtained from the `get_all_flowchem_devices()` function.

    files : dict
        A dictionary to hold file handlers for writing CSV logs from devices.

    loop : bool
        A boolean flag controlling the logging loop in the background thread.

    inspect : dict
        A dictionary to store inspection rules (conditions) for specific devices, components, and commands.


    Methods:
    -------
    __init__(experimental_id, address, discrete_time=1, add_info=None):
        Initializes the Watch object with experiment id, logging address, and time interval for logging.

    setup():
        Sets up logging directories, initializes CSV files for devices and components, and stores additional
        experiment information if provided.

    run():
        Starts a background thread that runs a logging loop, collecting data at specified intervals.

    __run_loop():
        Internal method that runs in a thread, periodically logging the values from the devices and comparing them
        against custom rules if provided.

    close():
        Stops the logging loop, closes all open files, and terminates the background thread.

    inset_inspect(device: str, component: str, command: str, condition: Callable):
        Inserts an inspection rule for a specific device, component, and command, defining the condition that the
        value must satisfy.

    __rule_tranlate(value, rule) -> bool:
        Translates and evaluates the received value against a provided rule, converting the value to a numeric
        format if necessary. Returns True if the condition is satisfied, or logs an error if not.
