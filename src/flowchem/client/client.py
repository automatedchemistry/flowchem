    Search for Flowchem devices using Zeroconf and return them as a dictionary.

    This function discovers Flowchem devices using Zeroconf and returns a dictionary
    containing the device names as keys and FlowchemDeviceClient instances as values.

    Args:
        timeout (float, optional): The time to wait (in milliseconds) for devices to be discovered.
                                   Default is 3000 ms (3 seconds).
        IP_machine (str, optional): Specifies the scope of devices to return. If "local",
                                    only devices on the local machine's IP are returned.
                                    If "all", all discovered devices are returned. Otherwise,
                                    a specific IP address can be provided to filter devices
                                    based on that IP.

    Returns:
        dict[str, FlowchemDeviceClient]: A dictionary with Flowchem device names as keys
                                         and FlowchemDeviceClient instances as values,
                                         representing the detected devices.

    Notes:
        - If the IP_machine is set to "local", the function will only return devices
          matching the local machine's IP address.
        - If the IP_machine is a specific IP, only devices on that IP will be included in the result.
        - The function waits for the specified timeout before stopping the search for devices.
