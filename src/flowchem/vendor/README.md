* **GetMac** The pypi package [getmac](https://pypi.org/project/getmac/) (MIT license) is included in the source as
 there are a couple of changes compared to upstream, mainly deprecation of Py2 support to avoid false-positive in mypy.
* **repeat_every()** From the pypi package [fastapi_utils](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi_utils/) (MIT license) is
 included in the source as the upstream package is incompatible with pydantic v2 (but not this function).
